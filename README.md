## ‚≠ê Introduction

The Cecile, a modern programming language designed for simplicity and flexibility.

## üçé Overview

Welcome to the Cecile Toy programming language.

The syntax of Cecile is influenced by traditional programming languages like JavaScript, Go, and Rust, with a strong emphasis on developer experience, readability and ease-of-use.

Cecile is written in Rust. Some of performance matter part is written in Unsafe Rust that makes fast enough to compete with traditional interpreted languages like Javascript, Python.

## üìï Features

- [x] Bytecode compiler
- [x] Garbage collected in runtime
- [x] Type Supported

## üî• Syntax examples

#### Variable Declaration
```rust
// Variable Declaration
let number: int = 1;
let string: String = "string";

// Ofcource you don't need to write type everytime you declare variable
let number = 2;
let string = "hello cecile";

```
#### Function Declaration
```rust
fn say_hello() -> String {
  return "hello";
}

println say_hello() // Out: "hello"
```

#### Type Declaration
```rust
type Point {
  x: int,
  y: int,
}

impl Point {
  fn new(x: int, y: int) {
    self.x = x;
    self.y = y;
  }
}

## ‚öôÔ∏èÔ∏è Build Guide 

### ü¶Ä Install Rust

We recommend installing Rust using [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). You can install `rustup` as follows:

- macOS or Linux:
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

- Windows (64-bit):  
  
  Download the [Windows 64-bit executable](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64) and follow the on-screen instructions.

### üêô Build from Source Code

We recommend installing Cecile by building from the source code as follows:

```bash
# Download the source code
git clone https://github.com/Hollowloki/Cecile
cd Cecile

# Install 'Cecile'
$ cargo install --path .
```

Now to use Cecile language, in your terminal, run:
```bash
cecile
```

let point: Point = Point();
```
